# CppReflection
Static library that allows you to reflect c++ types and use that information at runtime (find and call class method by name using pointer to object, get class member value etc).

Dependencies:
 - [EverydayTools](https://github.com/Sunday111/EverydayTools)
 - [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for tests
